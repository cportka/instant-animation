# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows Keep a Changelog
(https://keepachangelog.com) and the project uses Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org).

**Until a release is actually cut, changes fold into the current unreleased version** rather than
minting a new number each round — a version that was never tagged isn't a version. Once a release
has been published, the next change opens a new section. See `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

## [0.3.0] - Unreleased

Nothing has been released yet, so this is the whole project to date in one section. Intermediate
states that were later replaced — the cosy first composition, the cold monochrome pass, the
fading caption chrome, the distant planet — are not listed: they left nothing behind.

### Added

**The engine.** `site/lib/stage.js` owns device pixel ratio, resizing, the frame loop, pausing in
a hidden tab, and `prefers-reduced-motion` (which holds a still poster frame instead of moving). A
scene receives only a 2D context, a clock and a size — no DOM — which is exactly what lets every
scene render headlessly in CI. Randomness is seeded (`site/lib/rng.js`), so a scene looks
hand-placed but draws identically on every machine.

The stage also adapts: a scene can cap its render scale with `meta.maxDpr`, and if frames start
arriving slower than ~28fps the stage drops resolution further and restores it when the machine
recovers. The scene never hears about either — it always draws in CSS pixels.

**The channel change.** Moving between animations draws the two scenes exactly adjacent and pushes
them vertically past each other while the composite is torn apart — displaced slices, chroma
smear, and a bright seam riding the join — then it settles. It lives in the stage and operates on
rendered pixels, so it knows nothing about scenes and every future animation gets it for free.
Skipped entirely under reduced motion.

**VHS artefacts** (`site/lib/vhs.js`), modelled on a real tape failure: per-scanline shred, chroma
pushed to neon, long horizontal smears, hexagonal honeycomb dither, head-switching dropout bars
with noise inside them, rolling scanlines and grain. The displacement is real, not an overlay —
slices of the rendered frame are copied back over it.

Three levels of damage: ambient all the time, the heads giving out completely every ten seconds,
and — every seventy-one seconds — a **surge to ten times that**, which ramps up, leaves nothing of
the picture at all, and comes all the way back to baseline. The surge multiplies *passes* rather
than displacement: past about half the frame width a shifted slice simply lands off screen, so more
distance stops buying anything, while running the same zones again at offset times keeps
multiplying how much of the picture is torn.

Each cycle **dwells at its own maximum** rather than touching it in passing (`heldPulse`). A plain
sine bump is at full value for a single frame, so the worst moment of a fault is over before the
eye has settled on it — you register that something happened, not what. The envelope now splices a
plateau into the peak, with the rise and the fall keeping the shape they had: both cycles spend
about **five times as long** at full value as the bare bump did, the small one included. The
artefacts underneath go on churning while the envelope holds, so a held peak stays broken without
freezing.

**Wet black paint** (`site/lib/paint.js`) thrown over everything: small goopy flecks that read as
holes punched in the image, and brush strokes that drawl downward from a loaded head. Both are
built from one ribbon primitive — a spine with an independent half-width at every sample — so a run
bulges where paint gathers and pinches where it has thinned. That variation is the whole point: a
ribbon of constant width falling straight is a column, and a frame of columns is a fence. Strokes
swell somewhere along their length and lean by a fraction of that length rather than of the head,
so a long one wanders instead of hanging plumb.

The wet look comes entirely from the specular edge, since the paint itself is near-black, and a
catchlight has to sit *inside* its bead: a glow wider than the drop reads as a luminous bubble
hanging in space. Marks are placed on a jittered grid, because purely random ones clump into a
single mass while half the frame stays bare. Everything creeps on periods of two to five *minutes*
— you never see a drip move, only notice later that it has. Centres are kept off the sleeper; the
runs still cross them.

**The first animation — "Asleep Among the Stars"**, from *"a bed floating in space with someone
snuggled under the covers peacefully sleeping while the bed gently floats amongst the stars"*:

- Composed for scale. The bed is sized against the viewport's **short edge** rather than fitted to
  the frame, so it takes about a quarter of a desktop window and less on anything larger — the
  bigger the screen, the more lost it looks. It sits off-centre and the emptiness is the subject.
- It **rolls a full 360°** about the axis from the pillow to the foot of the bed — a vertical
  squash in projection, collapsing to a line edge-on and inverting past 90°. Eased so it dwells
  face-up and sweeps through the back, one turn every 44 seconds.
- Drift periods in **minutes, not seconds** (97s, 71s, and a 127s tumble), so it wanders the frame
  instead of bobbing in place.
- **Sunglasses** drift in, settle on the sleeper for a while, and drift off again. Nobody puts
  them there.
- The sleeper **snores**: the mouth opens on the out-breath, and every snore pushes a wireframe
  solid out into space. Breathing, the Z's and the echoes all run off one clock.
- A **black hole** with a pocket of visibly bent spacetime around it. Concentric discs of the
  frame are each magnified, twisted and blurred more than the one outside it — and the pass runs
  *between* the accretion disc and the shadow, so the disc is dragged through its own lens while
  the shadow and photon ring stay hard-edged. The magnification breathes and the twist wanders, so
  the pocket is never still.
- An **orbiting pair of neutron stars**, the scene's single light source: the disc's lit limb, the
  duvet's rim and the sleeper's face all derive their edges from that one position.
- **Curve stitching** — sets of straight lines whose envelope is a parabola — over a galactic band
  of clustered stars cut by soft dust lanes.
- **Nothing is clean.** Heavy coloured haze in three big washes plus seven smaller clouds that
  visibly travel and wrap, and a bloom pass that draws the whole frame back over itself blurred,
  slightly enlarged and slowly drifting, so every edge has a soft double that moves.

**The front-end** (`site/index.html`, `app.js`, `styles.css`): **no text at all.** The animation is
the page; the title and description survive only as the canvas label and a screen-reader live
region. Navigation is two soft chevrons floating at the top and bottom edges, each present only
when there is somewhere to go — so a single-animation gallery is nothing but the animation. The
gallery runs **newest → oldest**: down goes further back in time, up returns toward the present, by
chevron, scroll, space, arrow keys, or a vertical swipe. `#scene-id` deep links work.

**Headless render tests.** A recording 2D context (`tests/helpers/recording-context.mjs`) draws
every scene at three viewports and eight timestamps, failing on NaN geometry, colours built from
`undefined`, out-of-range alpha, unbalanced `save()`/`restore()`, and non-determinism. Plus
registry and site-integrity suites: no orphaned scene files, no missing assets, no root-absolute
paths (which would 404 on a project Pages site), no CDN dependencies, no visible text on the page,
and a gallery that is still newest-first.

**GitHub Pages deployment from Actions** (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`), gated on the tests.

**`/animate <description>`** slash command and `docs/AUTHORING.md`, so adding an animation is one
described sentence.

Initial scaffold via repo-bootstrap (Portka standard): branch-per-change workflow, an enforced
SemVer version sync, a test suite, and CI.

### Performance

The full-screen effects are the whole frame's cost. Three findings worth keeping:

- **Never sample the canvas you are drawing into.** `drawImage(ctx.canvas, …)` forces a flush per
  call: 78 slices cost **948ms**, the same 78 read from a separate buffer cost **4.2ms**, and the
  one full copy that fills that buffer is free. The stage owns the buffer and hands it to scenes,
  so scenes still never touch the DOM. Measured in headless Chromium at 2880×1800.
- **Resolution is the only lever that reliably works** on a fill-rate-bound pipeline, which is why
  `meta.maxDpr` and the adaptive fallback exist. Coming down is much faster than going up, and a
  catastrophically slow frame counts triple, so a machine well over its budget reaches a usable
  scale in about a second rather than half a minute. Star fills are batched by colour and alpha
  step for the same reason — ~900 individual fills became a few dozen.
- Profiling by wrapping `fill`/`drawImage` is useless here: it accounted for 6.5ms of a 94ms
  frame, because Skia defers rasterisation to flush. Measure end-to-end frame time and real
  achieved frame rate instead.

### Versioning

- A **MAJOR** bump means *an animation is finished and the next one begins*. `1.0.0` will be cut
  when *Asleep Among the Stars* is done and a second animation starts.
- Changes fold into the current unreleased version until a release is actually published.

Both recorded in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
